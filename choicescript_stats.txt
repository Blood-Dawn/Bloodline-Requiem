					#The Lupine Leaders
						The Millennium War was a cataclysmic event that shaped the world of Veilfall. It was a conflict that spanned ages, with the supernatural factions clashing over control, power, and survival. The Lupines, with their deep connection to nature and the moon, found themselves often as the peacekeepers, trying to maintain balance against the encroaching darkness that threatened to consume the world.

						These five Lupine leaders became the pillars of their society, embodying the qualities that would lead their faction through the war and into the annals of history. Each of them has a district within the Lupine territories named in their honor, and their stories are taught to every new generation as a reminder of the strength and perseverance of the Lupine spirit.

							#The Varkyr Leaders
								The Millennium War saw the Varkyrs using both their natural abilities and political savvy to navigate the conflict. As immortals, their perspective on the war was differentâ€”each battle was a move in a much larger game of chess that spanned centuries. The Varkyrs' affinity for the night and their natural predatory skills made them formidable opponents, and their leaders were as varied as they were terrifying.

						These Varkyr leaders etched their names into history with blood, strategy, and an unquenchable thirst for survival and power. Their legacies are preserved in the dark annals of the Varkyrs' libraries, whispered about in hushed tones in the halls of the Night Council, and are a testament to the enduring legacy of the vampire race in the world of Veilfall.
