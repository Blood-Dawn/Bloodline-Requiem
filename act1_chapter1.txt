Your reputation for getting the job done, no matter the complexity, precedes you. Today, a new assignment lands on your table, a choice that could unveil the deep-seated mysteries of Veilfall, or thrust you into the heart of the ancient conflict brewing afresh.


The parchment reads:
"Three tasks lay before you, choose wisely for each holds a key to the unfolding destiny of Veilfall.

1. Investigate the enigmatic Forsaken, their motives unknown, their allegiance a mystery.

2. Confront a pack of Lupines, their bitterness rooted in betrayal, their plans veiled in secrecy.

3. Eliminate a rogue Varkyr, whose bloodlust threatens the uneasy truce with the humans of Veilfall."

*label lupine_route
Under the pale moonlight, you journey to the Lupine's territory, the ominous Whispering Pines. As you tread cautiously into the grand forest, you become acutely aware of eyes upon you. Wolves of varying fur colors and sizes encircle you, their presence like whispers among the trees. They move with a silent, coordinated grace, their eyes reflecting the moonlight as they study your every movement, their noses twitching as they take in your scent.
*choice
    #Growl at them.
        With a subtle growl, you assert your presence, making a few of them back off while others seem intrigued by your audacity. The alpha, a majestic wolf with dark black fur symbolizing strength, steps forward, his eyes locking onto yours as if peering into your soul.
        *goto lupine_encounter_growl
    #Back off slowly and report back.
        You decide that discretion is the better part of valor. Slowly backing away, you make a mental note of what you've witnessed, ready to report back to the Assassin Guild. However, the eyes of the Lupines follow you, their curiosity piqued.
        *goto report_back
    #Pull out a weapon to defend yourself.
        With a swift motion, you unsheathe your weapon, the steel gleaming under the moonlight. The wolves grow tense, their growls resonating through the silent forest. Yet, amidst the tension, a white-furred wolf, a rare sight signifying a special status, steps forward with a calming aura, seemingly offering a chance for peaceful interaction.
        *goto lupine_encounter_weapon
    #Observe the wolves silently.
        You stand still, observing the wolves. The variety in fur colors tells tales of their nature. Black for strength, brown for balance, gray for agility, and the rare white for a special status or unique ability. Your silent observation seems to earn you a nod of respect from the alpha.

*label lupine_encounter_growl
The alpha wolf, with his black fur shimmering in the moonlight, approaches you. His eyes scrutinize you for a moment before he nudges his head, acknowledging your status as an Omega - the lowest rank within their hierarchy but a part of the pack nonetheless. The rest of the wolves, with their fur of brown, gray, and the occasional white, encircle you, their forms shifting into that of humans as they welcome you into their realm.

As you brandish your weapon, ready to defend yourself, the tension among the wolves rises. The alpha steps forward, his form shifting into a towering man with piercing eyes. 

"You have the heart of a wolf, but do you fight with honor?" he challenges, his pack readying themselves for a confrontation.
*choice
    #Shoot first, ask questions later.
        You decide to take the initiative, raising your weapon.

                The shot echoes through the Whispering Pines, the sudden violence momentarily stunning both packs. The lupines growl, their forms shifting as they prepare to retaliate. Your actions have surely strained the relations with the Lupines.

            #Throw a flashbang to disorient them.
                The flashbang bursts into a blinding light, disorienting the wolves momentarily.

            #Lower your weapon and explain your mission.
                You decide that violence wonâ€™t solve this situation. Lowering your weapon, you explain your mission from the Assassin Guild, hoping for a peaceful resolution.

In the shadows of the city, you search for the mysterious Forsaken. In the distance, you see a poster with an encrypted message.

*choice

        *goto tunnel_entrance
*label tunnel_entrance
You navigate through the twisted alleys of Veilfall until you reach the underground tunnel at 123 street. The eerie silence as you descend into the darkness sends a chill down your spine. The Forsaken's world is one veiled in shadows and mystery, an underground society that thrives in the hidden corners of Veilfall. You tread cautiously, aware that danger lurks with every step in this forsaken realm.

As you delve deeper into the tunnel, the distant echo of a chant grows louder. The air thickens with the ancient aura of rites long forbidden. The tunnel opens up into a vast, dimly lit cavern, where a congregation of the Forsaken is in the midst of a ritual. At the heart of the ritual, an artifact radiates with an eerie glow, its power resonating with the very core of the veil separating the realms.

*choice
    #Approach the congregation cautiously.

The journey back to the Assassin Guild's hidden lair is a mixture of anticipation and reflection, as the night's events play back in your mind. The city, despite its dark undertones, begins to stir with the early murmurs of dawn as you navigate through the labyrinthine alleys that lead to the guild's secret entrance.

As you step into the clandestine halls of the guild, the familiar blend of shadows and silence welcomes you. But this serenity is short-lived, as you're soon ushered into the presence of the Guild Master, a figure shrouded in enigma and feared for the ruthless efficiency in maintaining the guild's feared reputation.

*choice
    #Report everything in detail.
        You recount the night's events with precision, leaving no stone unturned. The Guild Master listens intently, the shadows dancing across his concealed features as you narrate your findings and encounters.

        *goto guild_master_response
    #Withhold some information for personal reasons.
        You provide a curated version of the night's events, keeping certain details close to your chest. The Guild Master seems to sense the omission but waits patiently for you to finish.
        *set AssassinGuild_relation -10
        *goto guild_master_response
    #Exaggerate your achievements.
        With a flourish, you embellish your tale, painting your actions in a heroic light. The Guild Master remains impassive, but you notice a twitch of amusement in the eyes of some guild members present.
        *set AssassinGuild_relation -5
        *goto guild_master_response

*label guild_master_response
The Guild Master remains silent for a long moment after you finish speaking, the room echoing with the remnants of your tale. Finally, he speaks, his voice a calm yet stern ripple through the silence.

"You have done well," he states, his words measured. "But remember, the shadows are both our cloak and our blade. We thrive in the unseen, and our actions echo through the veins of Veilfall. The balance between the factions is a delicate one, and our allegiance to none is our strength."

He dismisses you with a gesture, and as you step out of the room, the weight of his words sinks in. The game of shadows is a complex one, and the stakes are as high as ever.

*choice
    #Reflect on the Guild Master's words.
