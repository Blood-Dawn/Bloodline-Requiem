*comment The game begins



*comment Act 1 begins
In the shadowed annals of history, where the line between myth and reality blurs, lies the tale of an ancient world, forever altered by the Millennium War. But to understand the present, one must journey back to the origins of the conflict, to a time when ancient pacts bound the fates of all.

Era of the Pact (500 BW):
The world was a place of hidden magic and untamed wilderness, where supernatural beings roamed under the gaze of the moon and the cover of night. Among them, the Varkyrs and Lupines stood paramount, their powers vast, their enmity legendary. It was the deaths of two titans—the Progenitor of the Varkyrs and the Origin Wolf of the Lupines—that quelled the storm of their conflict. In their final, earth-shattering duel, both leaders fell, their demise sending ripples through the realms of the night.

In the aftermath, the surviving Varkyrs and Lupines, weary of endless strife, convened under the ancient oaks of Whisperwind Thicket. Amidst the blood-soaked leaves, they forged the Pact of the Midnight Sun, a solemn vow to uphold the balance and conceal their existence from the world of men. This uneasy peace was sealed at Mirror Lake, where the waters reflected the promise of a new dawn.

Millennium War (1 BW - 0 AW):
Yet, peace is a fragile thing. The threads of trust unraveled when a splinter faction of Varkyrs, hungering for dominion, desecrated the sacred site of Mirror Lake. Their betrayal ignited the flames of the Millennium War, a conflict so vast it consumed the known world in shadow and blood.

The war raged across centuries, its battles echoing through the deepest forests and the oldest cities. The Varkyrs, with their aristocratic might and dark magic, sought to ensnare the world in their web of influence. The Lupines, bound by the moon's call and the fierceness of their packs, fought for freedom and the sanctity of their lands.

Post-War Era (250 AW - 1000 AW):
As the war waned, the world emerged scarred but reborn. The Forsaken, children of both Varkyr and Lupine, rose from the ashes of conflict. Under the banner of Caius the Unbound, they carved a path for themselves, a testament to the possibility of unity amidst diversity.

Era of Shadows (1000 AW - 1300 AW):
The world healed, and the supernatural factions, now veiled in secrecy, wove their influence into the tapestry of human society. Veilfall, a city born of ancient magic and modern ambition, became the epicenter of this hidden world. Here, the Varkyrs held court in shadowed halls, the Lupines roamed the wilds, and the Forsaken sought their place among the stars.

Present Era (1500 AW):
Now, in the year 1500 AW, the fragile peace holds, maintained by the silent guardians of the night. But whispers of unrest stir, and the echoes of the past beckon brave souls to forge their destiny. In the heart of Veilfall, where history and the present collide, your journey begins—a requiem for bloodlines and a quest for redemption in a world that walks the fine line between darkness and light.
